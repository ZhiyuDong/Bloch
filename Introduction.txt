Each file is for fixing one parameter and scan another one.

The meaning of file names:

###########################

As "+", "=", "." maybe illegal in some system, I used "_" to replace all sign. 

For example,"increaseEx_B_1_5" means "Fix B=1.5 and increase Ex".

What does each file contains?

############################

In each file, you can find 3 things.

1. One figure named "parameter...". It shows you the line this file scans.

2. 6-panel figures * 26. Each figure correpond to one data point on the line (26 points for each line.)

3. One ".gif" figure. This is a short movie made from the 26 original figures.

The meaning of those 6-panel figures:

##############################


1. Two panels in left column: They are time evolution of momentum kx,ky and current Ix,Iy respectively. I plot for a small time scale to make motion in one period visible.


2. Upper middle: This panel shows the trajectory in k-space. In contrast to upper left panel, we observe a long timescale motion here. So whe particle is trapped in 1st BZ, you see a (nearly)closed orbit. When particle is deconfined, you see a linear line because kxky grows linearly with t in a long-term basis.


3. Lower middle: This panel shows the charge accumulation (or polarization), which is just the $ intergral(I*dt) $. I plot it to make DC current more visible(especially the sign of DC current). In particular, if you plot current I directlly, the amplitude of AC component is sometimes too large so that cover up all the DC signal. 


4. Two figures in right column: Fourier spectrum of k and I.

Meaning of the figure name

############################

Currently I used 2 letters to label each figure: upper case for the first one and lower case for the second, e.g. "Aa".
Two letters corresponds to two parameters. E.g. "A" means "Ex=1", "Z": "Ex=3.5"; "a": "B=0.01", z: "B=2.5".

There is an Excel file "FigName_Parameter_correspondence", where you can find a dictionary listing the correspondence.

I promise I will label the Figures in a more friendly way next time ;)
